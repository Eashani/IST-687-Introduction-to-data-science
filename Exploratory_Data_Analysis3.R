#The same trend is followed by Southeast airlines

#Day of month


#For airlines other than Southeast, 
#the satisfaction value averages around 3.3 for almost all days of month
#For Southeast airlines, the satisfaction value differs for different days.
#For the 4th, 7th, 10th days, it is 3.5 with values lesser than that for the other days

#cor(dataframe$Shopping.Amount.at.Airport, dataframe$Satisfaction)
#For airlines other than Southeast, 
#Shopping amount ranges from 0 to 900
#with customers who spend 700-800 units rating the Satisfaction at 4 (max) and 
#customers who spend 800-900 units rating the Satisfaction at 3 (min)
#For Southeast airlines, 
#Shopping amount ranges from 0 to 600
#with customers who spend 500-600 units rating the Satisfaction at 4 (max) and
#customers who spend 400-500 units rating the satisfaction at around 3.2 (min)

#This gives us an insight that customers do not spend more than 600 units on
#Shopping at airport when they are a Southeast customer

#The correlation between the two variables is 1.7% which is not very high

#customers who spend 500-600 units rating the Satisfaction at 3 (min)
#For Southeast airlines, 
#Eating and Drinking amount ranges from 0 to 800
#with customers who spend 700-800 units rating the Satisfaction at 5 (max) and
#customers who spend 200-300 units rating the satisfaction at around 3.3 (min)

#The 750 value could be an outlier (since we are getting an average rating of 5)

#The correlation between the two variables is 0.01% which is not very high
