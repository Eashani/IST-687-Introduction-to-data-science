satisfactionCancelled<-ggplot(df)+geom_bar(mapping=aes(x=Flight.cancelled,fill=Satisfaction),position="fill",width=0.4)+scale_fill_grey() + theme_classic()
#It can be seen that there are more non satisfied people where flights are cancelled. 
#This is explainable as cancelled flights could result in a negative review.

#Considering the flight time, there are almost equal number of satisfied and not satisfied customers.

satisfactionDistance<-ggplot(df)+geom_bar(mapping=aes(x=Flight.Distance,fill=Satisfaction),position="fill",width=0.4)+scale_fill_grey() + theme_classic()
#Same as flight time, the flight distance also has almost equal percentage of satisfied and non satisfied customers.

#In this plot, it is shown that there are more non satisfied customers where the arrival delay is greater than
#5 minutes.
#This indicates that although there may not be a difference in just a regular arrival delay, if the delay is
